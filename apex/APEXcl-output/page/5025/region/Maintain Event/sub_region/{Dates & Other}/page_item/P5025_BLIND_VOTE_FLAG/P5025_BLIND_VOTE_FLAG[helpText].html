If set, the "Public Voting" will be <i>blind</i> which means they will not see the Presenter or Company. <br>
Additionally, the Summary and Abstract will be de-identified of references to the Presenter, Co-presenter, and Company.<br>
If you want to <b>avoid</b> the de-identified references, change the "<code>ANONYMIZE_TOKENS</code>" parameter on <a href="f?p=&APP_ID.:5060:&SESSION.:::RIR:IREQ_NAME_KEY:ANONYMIZE_TOKENS">System Parameter</a> to "NO"
